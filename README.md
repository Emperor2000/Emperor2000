### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ 
My name is Vincent, I am a third year software engineering student located in the Netherlands. In my free time I like to dive into game development (Gamemaker, JS, C#). I have worked on several projects that are available to download (links in description). I have also worked on several bigger personal projects, additionally I maintain a library with sample projects for GameMaker Studio.



I maintain a portfolio website with simple contact details, about me, etc. [here](https://www.vincenthendriks.com "Vincent's portfolio")

I own a second portfolio website where I post tutorials, guides and more [here](https://www.hendracle.nl "blog/guides/tutorials")
