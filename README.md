### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ 
My name is Vincent, I am a software and game developer located in the Netherlands. In my free time I like to dive into game development (Gamemaker, JS, C#). I have worked on several projects that are available to download (links in description). Amongst a number of public and private repositories, I maintain a library with sample projects for GameMaker Studio.



I maintain a portfolio where you can learn more about me and get in touch with me [here](https://www.vincenthendriks.com "Vincent's portfolio").
